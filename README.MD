Some people invest in cryptocurrency, others buy Rare Pepes, for me it's domains.

I wanted to look for trends in the "top" 100k domains, to see if I find something interesting.

Common Crawl provides a wonderful dataset for top ranking domains. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for this experiment.

One of the challenges I bumped into was splitting domain names into meaningful words, which is not trivial. Fortunately, I didn't have to implement a custom solution, as good people of the internet has already taken care of it. (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8870261/how-to-split-text-without-spaces-into-list-of-words)

Also, as I didn't want to download GBs of data unnecesseraly, I created a solution for streaming and processing gzipped csv files on the fly.

Here are the top 50 most common words in top ranking domains:

Interesting! Although these areas may be saturated, you can always carve out a niche for yourself.

About the domains..

Obviously, the 1 word .com domains are all unavailable.

What about the 2 word .com domains though? Out of 2450 possible permutations, 42 domains (1.71%)are actually available!

Most of them are meh, but there are a few good ones, like googlemagazine.com. I mean sounds good, but I obviously wouldn't buy it because of potential trademark issues.

Of course, we only scratched the surface of the possibilites in this area, I've personally been experimenting with dozens - if not hundreds - of different ideas, looking for hidden gems in the domain marketplace.

It's fun, and open for everyone. A lovely place to develop new ideas and your skills.

And, eventually, you will always find what you are looking for. Probably even something better. :)
